✅ Placeholder to establish full folder structure for the project

This commit includes the following folders:

- `data/` → for raw & cleaned CSV files (e.g. `transition_issuance.csv`, `policy_gap_matrix.csv`)
- `notebooks/` → for Jupyter notebooks (e.g. `visual_analytics.ipynb`, `correlation_study.ipynb`)
- `visuals/` → for PNGs, charts, heatmaps used in README or notebooks
- `references/` → for PDF policy docs, external framework references

Each of these folders includes a `.gitkeep` file to make sure GitHub tracks them even if they’re empty.

GitHub doesn't allow multiple file creation at once, so we'll create `.gitkeep` inside each manually next.
